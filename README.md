# Lafore_R_OOP


    Hi. I'm not a strong programmer and decided to become it. I've devoted much time to leaning 
  programming for 2 months already and don't want to stop it.
  
    The repository contains all the tasks i've written for 2 month using the C++ book by Lafore R. 
    I've not done every programms.  I've written only interesting programms and examples.
  Some tasks have comments and conditions before the code. Usually i write tasks conditions
  in the cases i slightly change them. 
  
    The repository contains 16 chapters. Each chapter is numbered the same as the book chapters. I 
  know procedural programming well so i missed the first several chapters. I often try adding something 
  in the tasks so they may differ from book tasks.
    THe "other" folder is consisted of my own tests. There i check the information i didn't 
  understand the first time. Or i do there programms i found somewhere else.
  
    98% of programms i've done with VSC. Other 2% i've done with eclipse ide. I've used GCC 9.1.0 and GNU gdb 8.3
